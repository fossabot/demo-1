Bounds Request
--------------

Image Upload
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can ask for bounds of an **image binary**, by running the following command and replacing "my_test_image.jpg" with the path to the image on the file system.



.. code-block:: bash

   curl -v 'https://syteapi.com/offers/bb?account_id=[YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID]&sig=[YOUR_ACCOUT_SIGNATURE]&payload_type=image_bin' --data-binary @my_test_image.jpg



Image URL
~~~~~~~~~

You can also ask for bounds by sending an **image url**:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -v 'https://syteapi.com/offers/bb?account_id=[YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID]&sig=[YOUR_ACCOUT_SIGNATURE]&payload_type=image_bin' --data-binary @my_test_image.jpg


Users of this api should provide the ``{account_id}``, ``{sig}`` and ``{feed}`` params, as provided by Syte.


The API response for ``Bounds`` request will look like this_.

.. _this: http://wearesyte.com/apiexample/example_bb.json#

Every bound includes the following:
 - ``offers`` link - the link to use for getting offers on this bounding box.
 - ``label`` - the product category this bound assumes. this name is an indicator (some with typos).
 - Three points in the format of ``[x, y]``:
      1. ``center`` - the center of the box
      2. ``b0`` - the top left corner of the box
      3. ``b1`` - the bottom right corner of the box.

``x`` and ``y`` of any of the points are in fractions. numbers in the range ``[0..1]``.

To make an actual coordinate on an image, just multiply image height by ``y`` s and image width by ``x`` s.

All images assume origin (``[0,0]``) of the image to be top-left, and the bottom right is ``[1,1]``.
